# Attender

A self-tracking app for training session attendance built for use in Ars Gladiatoria, feel free to fork this over and use if you see a point to it, down the line I hope to get this templated out even more so it can be used sort of white-labelish... Not that anyone ever will read this but hey. 

Written using Go and HTMX because I want to live the meme. PostgreSQL for the database because I'm a snob. 

If you need more documentation read the code, if it isn't self-documenting and commented enough I'm not sure what to tell you
